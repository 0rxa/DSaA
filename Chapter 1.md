## Introduction
#### An algorithm is a finite sequence of instuctions each of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite length of time.


Three questions necessary to write an algorithm:

1. What is it supposed to do? (Specification)
2. Does it really do it? (Verification)
3. How well does it do it? (Performance analysis)


The *specification* should formalize the crucial details of the problem that the algorithm is intended to solve. There is no general requirement that the specification is complete or non-ambiguous.

*Verification* is sometimes achieved by testing some particular inputs to prove that the algorithm is not incorrect but since the data is theoritically infinite we need correctness proofs.

*Performance* of an algorithm relates to the resources required by it, such as how quickly it will run or how much computer memory it will use. These depend on the problem instance size, the choice of data and the details of an algorithm.

#### A data structure is a particular way of organizing data for particular types of operations.
#### Abstract data types are mathematical models of data structures or types with common features.
#### Encapsulation is the hiding and protection of implementational details from the user or outside access.
